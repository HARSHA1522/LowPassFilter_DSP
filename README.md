# LowPassFilter_DSP
Designing of Casual Low pass filter in matlab using 
**1. Eigen Filter Approach  
**2.Equiripple Filter Approach 



## 1. Eigen Filter Approach 
A new method of designing linear-phase FIR filters is pro- posed by minimizing a quadratic measure of the error in the passband and stopband. The method is based on the computation of an eigenvector of an appropriate real, symmetric, and positive-definite matrix.
## 2. Equiripple Filter Approach 
An equiripple filter is simply a filter with ripples of equal height. The magnitude response of actual digital filters may exhibit ripples. ... It is more important that the design of equiripple filters is such that the height of these ripples can be controlled.

## Conclusion
If we observe the Magnitude Response we can conclude that Equiripple Filter is better than Eigen Filter due to the starting Ripples in Stop Band.
